Build and Run Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the following steps to build and run examples demonstrating the
basic usage scenarios of |short_name| with SYCL*. Go to
:file:`<install_dir>/daal/<version>` and then set up an environment as shown in the example below:

.. note::

   All content below that starts with ``#`` is considered a comment and
   should not be run with the code.

1. Set up the |short_name| environment:

  .. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux\*

      On Linux, there are two possible ways to set up |short_name| environment:
      via ``vars.sh`` script or via ``modulefiles``.

      * Setting up |short_name| environment via ``vars.sh`` script

        Run ``vars.sh`` script to set up ``CPATH``, ``LIBRARY_PATH``, and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` for |short_name|:

          .. prompt:: bash

            source ./env/vars.sh

      * Setting up |short_name| environment via ``modulefiles``

        1. Initialize ``modules``:

          .. prompt:: bash

            source $MODULESHOME/init/bash

        2. Provide ``modules`` with a path to the ``modulefiles`` directory:

          .. prompt:: bash

            module use ./modulefiles

        3. Run the module to set up ``CPATH``, ``LIBRARY_PATH``, and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` for |short_name|:

          .. prompt:: bash

            module load dal    

    .. group-tab:: Windows\*

      Run ``vars.bat`` script to set up ``PATH``, ``LIB``, and ``INCLUDE`` for |short_name|:

      .. prompt:: bash

        /env/vars.bat

2. Copy ``./examples/cpp_sycl`` to a writable directory if necessary:

  .. prompt:: bash

    # If necessary, copy ./examples/cpp_sycl to a writable directory (since it creates temporary files)
    cp â€“r ./examples/cpp_sycl ${WRITABLE_DIR}

3. Set up the compiler environment for |dpcpp|.
   See |dpcpp_gsg|_ for details.

4. Build and run DPC++ examples:

  .. note::

    You need to have write permissions to the :file:`examples` folder
    to build examples, and execute permissions to run them.
    Otherwise, you need to copy :file:`cpp_sycl` and :file:`data` folders
    to the directory with right permissions. These two folders must be retained
    in the same directory level relative to each other.

  .. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux\*

      .. prompt:: bash

        # Navigate to DPC++ examples directory and build examples
        cd /examples/cpp_sycl
        make sointel64 example=cor_dense_batch # This will compile and run Correlation example using Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++ Compiler
        make sointel64 mode=build			   # This will compile all DPC++ examples

    .. group-tab:: Windows\*

      .. prompt:: bash

        # Navigate to DPC++ examples directory and build examples
        cd /examples/cpp_sycl
        nmake libintel64 example=cor_dense_batch+ # This will compile and run Correlation example using Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++ compiler
        nmake libintel64 mode=build			     # This will compile all DPC++ examples

  To see all avaliable parameters of the build procedure, type ``make`` on Linux\* or ``nmake`` on Windows\*.

5. The resulting example binaries and log files are written into the :file:`_results` directory.

  .. note::

    You should run DPC++ examples from :file:`cpp_sycl` folder, not from :file:`_results` folder.
    Most examples require data to be stored in :file:`examples\\data` folder and to have a relative link to it
    started from :file:`cpp_sycl` folder.


  You can build traditional C++ examples located in ``examples/cpp`` folder in a similar way.
