# Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library Apache Arrow\* Samples

Apache Arrow\* samples for the Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library (IntelÂ® DAAL) are designed to show how to use this library with the Apache Arrow library in a C++ application.

Unzip the archive with Intel(R) DAAL samples to your working directory (`<sample_dir>`).

## System Requirements
You can use Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow samples on Linux\*, Windows\*, and macOS\* operating systems. For a list of Intel(R) DAAL hardware and software requirements, refer to release notes for the version of Intel(R) DAAL you are using.

Apache Arrow implementations against which Intel(R) DAAL has been validated:
- Apache Arrow 0.15.1

---
**Note:** Intel(R) DAAL is expected to work on other Apache Arrow versions as well. Let us know if you have any troubles with the distribution you are using.

---

## Preparation Before Build and Run
### Apache Arrow support
You can download and install the Apache Arrow library from their [GitHub\* repository][arrow_repo]. Before running the sample make sure to set the environment variables `ARROWROOT` and `ARROWCONFIG` with the correct path and build type (debug or release, for details refer to the discription of the [building process][arrow_building]). 

For Linux\* and MacOS\* only: set variables `BOOST_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH` with the correct path to `libboost_system.a` and `BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH` with the correct path to `libboost_filesystem.a`.

### Setting Up the Build Environment
Before you build the sample, you must set certain environment variables that define the location of related libraries. Intel(R) DAAL includes the `vars` scripts that you can run to set environment variables:

On Windows\*, you can find the `vars.bat` batch file at:

- `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\windows\daal\bin\: vars.bat intel64`
  
On Linux\*, you can find the `vars.sh` shell script at:

- `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\linux\daal\bin: source vars.sh intel64`
 
On macOS\*, you can find the `vars.sh` shell script at: 

- `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\mac\daal\bin: source vars.sh`

---
**Note:** Sincee Apache Arrow does not support `32-bit` architectures, you can only build this sample on the `64-bit` architectures. 

---

For more information on how to set environment variables and configure Intel(R) DAAL, refer to Get Started Guides for the library.

## Build and Run Instructions

Choose the OS you are using and see how to build and run Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow C++ samples.

- [Windows\*](#windows)
- [Linux\*](#linux)
- [MacOS\*](#macos)

### Windows

#### Build sample

Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `build` parameter:

```
cd <sample_dir>\cpp\arrow

launcher.bat build
```

The command creates the `.\_results\intel64` directory and builds `*.exe` executables. It also creates a log file for build results.

#### Run sample

1. Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `run` parameter:

  ```
  cd <sample_dir>\cpp\arrow

  launcher.bat run
  ```

2. Select the same architecture parameter as you provided to the `launcher` command with the build parameter.

For each sample, the results are placed into the `.\_results\intel64\<sample name>\.res` file.

### Linux

#### Build sample

1. Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `make` command:

  ```
  cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

  make {libintel64|sointel64} compiler={intel|gnu} mode=build
  ```

2. From the `{libintel64|sointel64}` parameters, select the one that matches the architecture parameter you provided to the `vars.sh` script and that has the prefix that matches the type of executables you want to build: `lib` for static and `so` for dynamic executables.

The command creates a directory for the chosen compiler, architecture, and library extension (`a` or `so`). For example: `_results/intel_intel64_a`.

#### Run sample

Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `make` command in the run mode. For example, if you run the `vars` script with the `intel64` target:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make libintel64 mode=run
```

The `make` command builds a static library for the Intel(R) 64 architecture and runs the executable.

### MacOS

#### Build sample

1. Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `make` command:

  ```
  cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

  make {libintel64|dylibintel64} compiler={intel|gnu} mode=build
  ```

2. From the `{libintel64|dylibintel64}` parameters, select the one that matches the architecture parameter you provided to the `vars.sh` script and that has the prefix that matches the type of executables you want to build: `lib` for static and `dylib` for dynamic executables.

The command creates a directory for the chosen compiler, architecture, and library extension (`a` or `dylib`). For example: `_results/intel_intel64_a`.

#### Run samples

Go to the C++ Apache Arrow samples directory and execute the `make` command in the run mode. For example, if you run the `vars` script with the `intel64` target:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make libintel64 mode=run
```

The `make` command builds a static library for the Intel(R) 64 architecture and runs the executable.
